# cifar10-image-classification-cnn
Image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 classes. This project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a CNN model using TensorFlow and Keras, achieving competitive accuracy in image recognition tasks
